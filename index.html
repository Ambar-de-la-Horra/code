  	 		<h2>Prince of Barkness</h2>
  	 		<h3>The Prince loves the nerdy style. Mostly he just wears a simple crew or V-neck sweater which he usually styles to look casual with jeans, or dressed up with a skirt. He is up to everything: From oversize Gucci glasses to high-water Prada suits. We can be sure that this season the nineties nerd stages a major comeback on the doggy runways.</h3>

  	 		<h2>Sherlock Bones</h2>
  	 		<h3>Sherlock's French style is less about appearing perfect and more about appearing effortless. He is a little more chic, very classic. His inspiration goes from Brigitte Bardot in a Breton-striped top over an old Frenchman playing a sun-soaked game of petanque in a beret to the impossibly slim Parisian woman dressed head-to-toe in black.</h3>

  	 		<h2>The Notorious D.O.G.</h2>
  	 		<h3>Snoop Dogg's best friend has a weakness for the iconic "gangsta" style and mostly combines baggy jeans and an oversized, extremely clean white T-shirt. He actually buys some fresh white T-shirts instead of washing the used ones. They are also several sizes above what would be considered a normal T-shirt fit. Sometimes we see him wearing tank-top style undershirts without any pants but humming his latest self made autotune track.</h3>
